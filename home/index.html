            <!-- What does your company do? -->
            <!-- What kind of services do you provide? -->
            <!-- Why do they have to choose you over your competitors -->
            <!-- Anything that you do as a business unit to attract customers. -->
            <p> Cicero's 1st-century BC home offered generations of our family countless memories
                and we knew we had to make sure it had to end up in the right hands.
                Then our company was born. <b>We provide a platform to connect buyer's and sellers
                    in a way that all parties can find what they are looking for.</b>
                We have a better selection of homes offered directly from sellers, <b>which also means a
                    better price than our competitors.</b>
                We make everything so easy from beggining to end that you have to give our service a try!
                We even offer our sellers their own dashboard to control on monitor their transaction!
